## File Structure

```
apps/web/src/app/
â”œâ”€â”€ sign-in/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx          # Custom sign-in page
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ layout.tsx        # Sign-in layout with metadata
â”œâ”€â”€ sign-up/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx          # Custom sign-up page
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ layout.tsx        # Sign-up layout with metadata
â””â”€â”€ middleware.ts         # Updated to include custom routes
```

## Customization

### Styling

The pages use Tailwind CSS classes and can be easily customized:

- **Colors**: Modify the gradient and color schemes in the component files
- **Animations**: Adjust the decorative element animations in `globals.css`
- **Layout**: Change the card size, spacing, and positioning

### Clerk Appearance

The `appearance` prop in both components allows deep customization of Clerk's UI elements:

```tsx
appearance={{
  elements: {
    formButtonPrimary: "bg-slate-900 hover:bg-slate-800",
    formFieldInput: "bg-white border border-slate-300",
    // ... more customizations
  },
}}
```

### Redirects

- **Sign-in redirect**: Currently set to `/feed`
- **Sign-up redirect**: Currently set to `/onboarding`
- Modify the `redirectUrl` prop in the components to change these

## Pages Included

### Sign-In Page (`/sign-in`)
- Email/password authentication
- Social provider buttons (if configured)
- Link to sign-up page
- Responsive design with gradient background

### Sign-Up Page (`/sign-up`)
- User registration form
- Email verification flow
- Terms of service and privacy policy links
- Link to sign-in page

## Integration

The custom pages are already integrated with:

- âœ… Middleware protection
- âœ… Existing hero and CTA components updated
- âœ… Proper routing and redirects
- âœ… Dark mode theming
- âœ… Mobile responsiveness

## Testing

To test the authentication flow:

1. Start the development server: `yarn dev`
2. Navigate to `/sign-up` to create a test account
3. Check email for verification (if enabled)
4. Navigate to `/sign-in` to test login
5. Verify redirects work correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Environment variables not loaded**: Restart the dev server after updating `.env.local`
2. **Clerk keys not working**: Double-check keys from dashboard match your environment
3. **Redirects not working**: Verify paths in Clerk dashboard match your routes
4. **Styling issues**: Check Tailwind CSS is properly configured and building
